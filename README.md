# Covid19 and Influenza Comparison
How Covid19 influenced on Influenza detection?
I have split my analysis by two parts:

- First part contain Extracting / Transforming and Cleaning Data [part1](https://github.com/mborycki/Covid_Influenza_Comparison/blob/main/Flu_Covid_Cleaning.ipynb)
- Second part refers to Analysis / Visualisation [part2](https://github.com/mborycki/Covid_Influenza_Comparison/blob/main/Flu_Covid_Analysis.ipynb)

Please find more detailed description of this project in my **[portfolio](www.mariuszborycki.com)**

### To make the analysis I have used two sources:
- Covid19: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data
- Influenza: https://flunewseurope.org/VirusCharacteristics
